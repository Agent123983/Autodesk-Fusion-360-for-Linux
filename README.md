<h1>Fusion-360 - Linux (Wine Version)</h1>
<p>
I decided to use WINE to run this program just as well under Linux as it did under Windows, so that you no longer have to run two operating systems just to be able to use Fusion 360.

As a Linux distribution I use openSuse Leap 15.2 with the desktop environment Xfce and the Wine version from the standard repositories. I also use an Nvidia graphics card and use the drivers from the community repository.

The program is actually already running, but I go a step further and have added the CUDA repository from Nvidia to use the CUDA toolkits.

This gives me more performance for Fusion 360 and my other programs that I use.

Of course you can also use another Linux distribution, because on most of these systems you also get access to the programs and packages I use.
